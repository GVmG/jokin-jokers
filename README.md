# Jokin' Jokers
A custom texture pack for balatro replacing 15 jokers with revamped, jokey designs by u/cookiezxp on Reddit.

# Installation
You will need to install [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) for this mod to run.

When you've done that, download the [latest release](https://github.com/GVmG/jokin-jokers/releases/latest) of this mod - it will be a .zip archive containing all the files for the mod to work.

Extract those files to your `%appdata%/balatro/Mods` folder so that the lovely.toml file is inside the `jokin jokers` folder. Make sure it's not in a subfolder! The file structure should be as follows: `%appdata%/balatro/Mods/jokin jokers/lovely.toml`

Once that's done, launch Balatro and enjoy your new textures!
